# Hi there, I'm Achilleas! 👋

I'm a data analyst at the UK's #1 provider of public sector early payment programmes and market intelligence. I hold an MSc in Data Analytics and am a GradStat member of the Royal Statistical Society. In my free time I enjoy putting datasets under my microscope, exploring statistical techniques, creating interesting visualisations, and sharing those with my network.

### 🐱‍💻 I am currently working on:

- Expanding my skillset around project management
- Building my data science portfolio
- Creating a series of educational articles on best practices
- Exploring real-world applications of advanced statistical modeling
